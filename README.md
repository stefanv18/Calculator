## About Me
*Where did I grow up?*

I'm a bit of an oddball. I grew up in a few different countries: Angola, Malawi, Swaziland, Mozambique, South Africa, The Philippines, Bangladesh, Mongolia and the United States. My father's work took us to many different places around the world. Around 2017 was when I came to live in India. 

*What are my hobbies/passions?*

1. I've always loved music as a child - since I was 10 years old to be exact. I started playing the trombone, tuba, piano, guitar, and drums at different times in my life. I also sing quite a bit and enjoy being a part of the occasional ensemble/choir.
2. Another huge passion of mine is exploring the outdoors. I'm a huge lover of nature and try to keep that part of me alive wherever I go. I'm into kayaking, rock climbing, trekking, and mountain biking. Although I don't get to do any one of these in particular to a great extent as of recently, I do look for the next opportunity while here in Delhi.
3. lastly, for the longest I can remember, I've always tinkered with electronics, toys, computers and pretty much anything with circuitry or a motherboard. I like to be able to take things apart just to see how they really work on the inside (even if I don't understand it fully).

*Where do I see myself in the future?*

I see myself writing a lot of programs for various needs and organizations, learning multiple coding languages and potentially working with non-profits that help children to start programming at an early age. I believe it's vital in today's day and age to learn at least 2 computer languages. I am married but we have no kids yet so I definitely want to have children. There's quite a lot that I would like to achieve in the next few years: travel to more countries, bicyle a long tour route in some remote place, and establish a physiotherapy clinic for my wife.
